# ðŸ§¶ Priceloop NoCode Python External Functions Templates

You can create your own functions and then call them inside our [NoCode table](https://priceloop.ai/nocode), just like a builtin function. Here are some easy examples that you can use to write your own functions. Some of them are also deployed on our platform. More information on how to deploy it to our platform please also go to our [documentation](https://priceloopai.notion.site/External-Functions-f78d153ab7b94a5f8a2f2cc5baa5e9d3).
